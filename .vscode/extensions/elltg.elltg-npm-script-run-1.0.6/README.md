## Features

This extension lets you run NPM scripts from the command palette.

Run the extension from the command palette and it will list the scripts from package.json file at the root of the workspace.

Upon selecting an item, it will focus the last used terminal and send the text `npm run ${selected script name}` which will of course result in that script being run.
