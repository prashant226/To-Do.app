# Behavior Coverage

> ðŸ’¡ There's a lot you can do. [Check out our README](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codium.codium#getting-started) for details!

CodiumAI generates a behavior list of your code and marks each behavior as covered or not covered based on the generated test.

For behaviors that are not covered by tests, you can click on the `Generate test` button next to it, and CodiumAI will generate a test
for this behavior.

Missing a behavior? Simply add new behaviors and generate tests for them:
